# Ardoq test

A Vue project in WebStorm along with Firestorm. The chosen API was: https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart. 

- The reason for the unfinished site is that the API was restricted. Specifically, the desired API actions for the remaining pages: team info, and all available matches, were restricted.

This was a fun test since I have never before used either Vue and Webstorm nor Firebase. Therefore I was introduced to new technologies.

(I have left outsome of the different node_modules from the repository because of the substantial amount of them)

# footbal_api

> Website to see fotball and team information
